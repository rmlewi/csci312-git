This repository houses materials shared with my CSCI 312-01 class, Fall 2025.

The notebooks are in two forms.
* There are the raw notebooks in pristine condition; these are the .ipynb files.
* There are HTML version of the notebooks after they are run; these are the .html files.

If you want to run the notebooks on your computer you will need to install a Jupyter bash kernel.  I use [this one](https://github.com/takluyver/bash_kernel).  You will also need versions of the gcc and clang compilers that are current through C23.
