    "\n",
    "**Line 1.**  This is a C preprocessor directive.  The file `stdio.h` is called a **header file** (hence the suffix `.h`) since it appears at the head of the file.  The name `stdio.h` comes from the fact that this file contains information about **standard i/o**.  The code in this file is inserted by the C preprocessor at the location of the `#include` directive.  This particular file contains, among many other things, a **function prototype** for the function `printf()` describing the number and type of inputs to the function and the type of the value returned by `printf()`.  The function `printf()` returns an integer that is the number of bytes successfully printed (14, in this case).\n",

    "<p style=\"text-indent: 4em\"><code>__name__ == __main__</code></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Every C/C++/Java program must have a `main()`.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `int` in front of `main()` is a **type declaration**.  Here it says that `main()` is a function that returns a value of type `int` (integer).  There are also two inputs to `main()`, an `int` named `argc` and a variable of type `char**` (we will explain this later) named `argv`.  The argument `argc` is the number of elements in `argv`, while `argv` is an array of strings that contains the command line arguments; Python's [`sys.argv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.argv) is the equivalent (Python borrowed the idea from C).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lines 4 and 7.**  In C/C++ the body of a function is enclosed in squiggly brackets `{ }`, whereas in Python it is indented.  **Indentation has no syntactic meaning in C/C++.**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Line 5.**  Here `printf()` is a function similar to Python's `print()` function. Unlike Python's `print()` the `printf()` function in C does not include a newline by default so we must do so ourselves with `\\n`.  The escape characters (e.g., `\\t` for tab) are the same in C/C++/Java as in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings in C/C++/Java are delimited by double quotes: `\"Hello, world!\\n\"`.  Single quotes are not an option as they are in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Line 6.**  Finally, the `return` statement is familiar from Python.  Here the return value is returned to the program's execution environment."
