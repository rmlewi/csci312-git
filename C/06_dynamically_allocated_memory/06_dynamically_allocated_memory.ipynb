    "CPython, the reference implementation of Python, is written in C and uses pointers extensively.\n",

    "For instance, the Python `bubblesort()` function above takes a list `a` as its input and sorts it, and the sorting persists after we return from the function.  This is similar to the swap function we just looked at.  CPython is passing a pointer to the list to `bubblesort()` and that allows us to manipulate the actual list in memory rather than a copy of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "[CPython lists are actually arrays of pointers to Python objects](https://docs.python.org/2/faq/design.html#how-are-lists-implemented-in-cpython).  This makes list references extremely efficient, since accessing, say, `a[42]` is a matter of going directly to the 42nd entry in an array of pointers and then dereferencing the pointer.  If we used a true list then we would need to travel through the objects `a[0]` through `a[41]` before we could access `a[42]`.  The fact that we are storing pointers to Python objects rather than the objects themselves means we are storing values of the same type in the array so lists can be represented by heterogeneous types of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "CPython also handles all the memory management for you.  In particular, CPython manages [garbage collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)), which is the reclamation of memory from variables that are no longer in use."
